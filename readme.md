## CPP Mege Sort Algorithm
### Adapted from Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, et al.

The purpose of this algorithm is to sort a random set of integers into the ordered permutation using divide and conquer. The algorithm proposed by Cormen, et al. is called the "merge sort." I will be implementing this algorithm in C++.
